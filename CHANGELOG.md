and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.6] - 2024-09-15

### Fixed

- Fix parsing error of empty lines, common at the end of the sinli message files.
- Changed LibrosDoc.Book.PRICE_TYPE's type from string to an existing encoded type, as it should be.
- Fixed a misleading detail of a usage example at README.md

## [1.2.5] - 2024-06-12

### Fixed

- Document.from_str(sinli_document_in_string) is fixed now.

### Changed

- Update contact email at pyproject.toml

## [1.2.4] - 2024-06-05

### Changed

- Add to `Document.from_filename()` an optional `encoding` argument


### Fixed

- Fix `Document.from_str()`. It was totally not working. It is now.


## [1.2.3] - 2024-06-05

### Added

- Add attribute lines_by_type to Document. Keys are the strings from each Document's Line subclass, like "Header", "Book" or "Detail"

### Fixed

- Document.doctype_code is populated correctly now

### Removed

- Removed unused attribute Document.doctype_codes

## [1.2.2] - 2024-05-29

### Fixed

- Fix bug. Handle empty fields that are EncodedType in Book() class.

## [1.2.1] - 2024-05-05

### Changed

- Fix bug. Of all SinliCode, only ORDER_SOURCE was being recognized. We need to add a typing to attributes so that @dataclass considers them as fields.

## [1.2.0] - 2024-05-01

### Changed

- Manage non-text values errors when parsings fields from a Line
- Fix bug on parsing document from string
- Refactor SinliCode:
  - replace Enum with dataclass
  - each encoded type has now its own class that inherits from EncodedField
  - when parsing lines, the field is saved as an EncodedField instead of its
      raw value
  - we can compare and set values with meaningful and autocompletable names,
      like `ORDERSOURCE.CLIENT` instead of `"C"`
- Fix bug on Document.to_readable(). Now, the result is a complete new document
    that doesn't reference to the original. This is important because readable
    fields can't be converted back nor serialized to sinli strings.

## [1.1.5] - 2024-04-10

### Added

- Parsing and building  SINLI messages (email) subject lines

## [1.1.4] - 2023-07-12

## [1.1.3] - 2023-06-27

### Fixed
